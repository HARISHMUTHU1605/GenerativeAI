            "\n",
            "This document is a collection of resume samples, not a single resume. Therefore, analyzing it as a single resume isn't applicable. Instead, I'll provide feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the *samples* provided, along with general improvement suggestions.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Strengths of the Sample Resumes:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Variety of Formats:** The handout showcases chronological, functional, and combination resume formats, catering to different career levels and backgrounds.  This is helpful for demonstrating the various approaches.\n",
            "* **Clear Contact Information:**  Each sample clearly presents contact details, making it easy for recruiters to connect.\n",
            "* **Quantifiable Achievements:** Many samples effectively use numbers to quantify accomplishments (e.g., \"15% increase in sales,\" \"$72,000 in annual revenue\").  This adds weight and credibility.\n",
            "* **Targeted Objectives/Summaries:** Most samples include objectives or summaries tailored to specific fields, helping to focus the resume's message.\n",
            "* **Showcase of Skills:**  Technical skills, language skills, and soft skills are highlighted appropriately in different samples.\n",
            "* **Inclusion of Relevant Coursework:**  Samples for recent graduates and those seeking internships wisely include relevant coursework.\n",
            "* **Good Formatting (Within Samples):** Individual samples are generally well-formatted, easy to read, and visually appealing.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Weaknesses of the Sample Resumes:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Outdated (June 2015):** Resume best practices evolve.  The advice regarding online resume builders and templates is outdated. While some builders still produce poorly formatted resumes, many reputable options exist today.  The samples themselves might benefit from a more modern aesthetic.\n",
            "* **Inconsistent Formatting (Across Samples):** While individual samples are well-formatted, the overall document lacks consistency in font, spacing, and headings between samples.  This makes the handout feel less professional.\n",
            "* **Overuse of \"IMA. SAMPLE\":**  The repetitive \"IMA. SAMPLE\" labeling is distracting and unnecessary.  Simple headings like \"Chronological Resume Example - Marketing\" would be more effective.\n",
            "* **Some Objectives Too Vague:**  While many objectives are targeted, some are generic and could be stronger (e.g., \"Position in market research or financial analysis...\" in Sample IV).\n",
            "* **Inconsistent Use of Keywords:**  While some samples incorporate keywords well, others could be improved by adding more industry-specific terms.\n",
            "* **Missing Dates for Some Activities:**  Some samples omit dates for activities like volunteer work or professional affiliations, weakening their impact.\n",
            "* **\"References Available Upon Request\" is Unnecessary:** This is implied and takes up valuable space.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Missing Sections (N/A):**  Since these are samples, they cover various sections as appropriate for different situations.  However, a real resume should always include contact information, experience (or equivalent), and education.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Update Content:** Refresh the document with current resume best practices and modern design trends.\n",
            "* **Improve Consistency:**  Standardize formatting across all samples for a more polished presentation.\n",
            "* **Use Clearer Headings:**  Replace \"IMA. SAMPLE\" with descriptive headings for each example.\n",
            "* **Strengthen Objectives:**  Make all objectives specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).\n",
            "* **Optimize Keywords:**  Research industry-specific keywords and incorporate them strategically throughout the samples.\n",
            "* **Include All Relevant Dates:**  Add dates for all activities and experiences.\n",
            "* **Remove \"References Available Upon Request.\"**\n",
            "* **Add a Section on Modern Resume Trends:**  Include information on ATS optimization, online portfolios, and personal branding.\n",
            "* **Provide More Context for Accomplishments:** Instead of just listing tasks, explain the impact of those tasks.  Use the PAR (Problem-Action-Result) method.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Feedback on Clarity, Structure, and Tone:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Clarity:**  The writing within individual samples is generally clear and concise. However, the overall document's structure could be improved.\n",
            "* **Structure:**  Organizing the samples by category (e.g., chronological, functional, specific industries) would enhance readability and usability.\n",
            "* **Tone:** The tone is appropriately professional and informative.\n",
            "\n",
